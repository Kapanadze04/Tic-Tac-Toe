# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Summary

- "Frontendmentor.io" challenge. The well-known entertainment game Tic-Tac-Toe. Specifically this app is designed for 2 people where one plays with "X" and the other plays with "O". The winner is the one who fills the boxes horizontally, vertically, or diagonally first.

## Principle of operation of the application

- First, one player chooses the X or O they want to play with. The "New game" button starts the game.
- X starts the game, and the moves will take place in turn.
- Whichever symbol wins the game. Accordingly, the score will be added to it in the X(P1) or X(P2) column. But it is possible that the game ends in such a way that no player can arrange the tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, in which case a tie will be recorded, and this result will also be added to the "TIES" graph.
- If the players wish to cancel the results. Click the "Rotate arrow" button.
